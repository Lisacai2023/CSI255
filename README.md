- **Name**: Hongfei Cai
- **Year and Qtr**: 2 year Qtr 1
- **Additional Teammate (If working in team)**: None

## Introduction:
- Provide context and motivations of the project.
    - Why did you decide to work on this project?
      - I never had the experience to create a game before. I decided to work on this project to learn the Unity engine and use it to design my first game. I also want to through the programming process to enhance my other coding language skills such as C# and Visual Studio Code. 
       
- What are your goals for this project?
  - To learn the Unity engine and develop a 2D mini kid-friendly game.
  - Continue to dive into C# and Visual Studio Code, and combine them into the game programming.
  - Practice creating whole process game programming. From the beginning of the concept to the end of the interactive game platform.
  - Practice designing user interactive game platforms to understand user experiences on the game.   
    
- What do you project your final project look like?
  - My final project will look like a 2D mini kid-friendly game. 2D game my idea is to design a game like car carries with package and delivery it. 
	 
- What are the specific features you deem required to implement for this project?
   - For 2D game, having a user interaction platform
       
- What are features that you would like to implement if given the time? (Pre-project)
  - I would like to implement 2D car design apperance.
  - In the different game levels have different maps.
- How difficult do you think this project will be?
  - I think it could be a lot of challenge for me because developing a game is new for me. I have to learn the whole process.
- What skills do you plan to develop with this project that will be useful for your job search?
  - Increase knowledge in C#, JavaScript and game engine software.
  - Practice in creating a project.
- What is the industry like for this kind of application (such as mobile application, web development, data analysis, etc.)?
  - Developing this project can teach me some basic knowledge about the entire game design process and user-interactive experience. This learning experience is useful in web development.
